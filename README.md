# Data Analysis Report: User Behavior, Cooking Preferences, and Order Trends

## Overview
This project involves analyzing datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends to uncover insights and provide actionable business recommendations. The analysis includes cleaning and merging datasets, exploring relationships, and creating visualizations to support findings.

## Objective
The main objectives of this analysis are:
- Identify patterns in user behavior and order trends.
- Analyze the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders.
- Discover demographic factors influencing user engagement.
- Provide business recommendations based on data insights.

## Datasets
The analysis utilizes the following datasets:
    
     1. UserDetails: Contains user demographic information such as age, location, and registration date.
     2. CookingSessions: Includes data on session start and end times, session ratings, and duration.
     3. OrderDetails: Provides information on order dates, meal types, dish names, order status, and spending amounts.

## Methodology

##### 1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
   - Ensured consistency in data formats (e.g., date fields).

##### 2. **Data Merging**:
   - Combined datasets using common keys such as `User ID` and `Session ID`.

##### 3. **Analysis**:
   - Explored the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders.
   - Identified popular dishes and spending patterns.
   - Analyzed the impact of demographics on engagement.

##### 4. **Visualization**:
   - Created scatter plots, bar plots, heatmaps, and boxplots to illustrate key findings.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations support the findings:
##### 1. **Bar Plot**: Total Orders by Location.
##### 2. **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between Cooking Sessions and Total Orders.
##### 3. **Heatmap**: Correlation between demographic factors and spending.
##### 4. **Point Plot**: Distribution of Total Orders by Age.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To organize and present the analysis interactively.

## Usage

##### 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
##### 2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
##### 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis_report.ipynb
   ```

##### 4. Follow the analysis and visualizations within the notebook.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights into user behavior and order trends. By targeting high-performing locations and addressing low-engagement areas, businesses can optimize their strategies to increase user retention and revenue. Future work could include advanced predictive modeling to forecast user behavior.
